last final things to do:
routes:
-buttons for taken/next semester/undo in course details (2 PUT, 2 DELETE routes) (Andrew)
-postFeedback button in About page (POST http route)
-add/delete majors and minor in user settings (2 PUT, 2 DELETE routes)

other:
-delete old database
-take out text button in main graph
-take out drop down in course details
-error handling double check (I think since we mostly copied the workshop we should be all set but we should make sure)
-finish up the written report
