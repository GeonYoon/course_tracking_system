FUNCTIONS THAT NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
getCourseData with emulateServerReturn (for course details page) - this is why in the main app, clicking on one of the courses
  that is in the new database but not the old one causes an error. We need to switch course details to load data from new server.
the two buttons in course details need to write to the real database (PUT, DELETE) - this is why clicking "I've taken this class" in
  course details does not give a response in the main app - these buttons currently don't modify the new database
the user should be able to add/take out majors/minors in their settings (PUT, DELETE)
the user should be able to post feedback (POST)
the user should be able to add/take out saved graphs(POST or PUT, DELETE)

OTHER STUFF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
json schema matching (copy from workshop)
delete old database (easy once we're done with everything else)
error handling
written report

OTHER FEATURES THAT SHOULD BE ADDED:
take picture of graph on main screen
classes that are in multiple majors not represented correctly in main app - fix by keeping track of all nodes added to the main graph,
  and only adding new ones if they haven't been added yet.
